This repository features the code used and results obtained during my bachelor thesis for artificial intelligence. <br>

I sought to analyze the differences caused by expanding a standard evolutionary game by implementing asymmetry and social networks. <br>
Running `model.py` will start a simulation running four different versions of the evolutionary game model. This is done using the `run()` function to allow an average to be created of the different simulation. Currently the file will run the simulation 20 times with 100 generations. These can be altered by changing the parameter values in the `run()` function. Different parameters can be passed to change the execution of the simulation.
